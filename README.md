Regression Dummy Variables -
> Multicollinearity - when there are more than 1 collinear variables then ignore 1 of them.
> OneHotEncoder - this is different frrom label encoder. Latter gives numerical denotion to a label like ocmpany name for putting them in a model.
  Onehotencoder on the other hand splits 1 column into multiple and assigns 0100 so that no encoding changes weight of variables
